# Testing Policy

## Property-Based Testing Approach

When implementing property-based tests for this project:

- **DO NOT** run the tests during implementation
- **DO NOT** attempt to verify tests pass during the task
- **ONLY** create the test files with proper structure and implementation
- The user will run tests separately when they choose to

## Rationale

This project focuses on creating the test infrastructure and test code. Test execution and validation will be handled separately by the user or CI/CD pipeline.

## Implementation Guidelines

When asked to implement property-based tests:
1. Create the test file with proper imports and structure
2. Implement the test logic according to the property specification
3. Ensure the test references the correct requirements
4. Mark the task as complete without running the test
5. Do not attempt to validate or execute the test code
